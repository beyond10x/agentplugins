description: Check whether the ESS plugin and the `ess` CLI are current, and upgrade them with the user's confirmation. Use when the user asks whether ESS is up to date or to upgrade or update it, when a session-start line starting with `b10x:` names `ess`, or when an `ess` command behaves differently from what an ESS skill describes.

# Upgrade ESS

```bash
b10x upgrade ess --host claude --out ~/.local/state/b10x/plan.json
```

Use `--host codex` in Codex. It compares the installed `ess` plugin with what the marketplace serves and the `ess` on `PATH` with
the newest ESS release, and prints each difference with the action that fixes it. Nothing is
changed yet.

- Nothing to change: say "ESS is current" with both versions, and stop.
- Otherwise show the actions in one list and ask once. After a clear yes:
  `b10x setup apply --plan ~/.local/state/b10x/plan.json --yes`.
- A new plugin version loads in a new session; until then `b10x skill ess:<skill>` prints the new text.

No `b10x`? Follow https://github.com/beyond10x/agentplugins/releases/latest/download/SETUP.md first.

## Next

- Continue the work that prompted the check: `ess:specifying`, `ess:retrofitting` or
  `ess:testing-conformance`.
